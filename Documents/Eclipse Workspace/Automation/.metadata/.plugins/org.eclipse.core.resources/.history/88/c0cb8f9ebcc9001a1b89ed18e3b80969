 * Java Naming conventions
  		Java naming convention is a rule to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc.
  		But, it is not forced to follow. 
  		So, it is known as convention not rule. 
  		These conventions are suggested by several Java communities such as Sun Microsystems and Netscape.
  		All the classes, interfaces, packages, methods and fields of Java programming language are given according to the Java naming convention. 
  		If you fail to follow these conventions, it may generate confusion or erroneous code.
