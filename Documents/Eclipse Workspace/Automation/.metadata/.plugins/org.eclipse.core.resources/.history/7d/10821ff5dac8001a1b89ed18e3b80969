/*
 *Matrix relates to mathematics that can be defined as a 2-dimensional array in the form of a rectangle which is filled either with numbers or symbols or expressions as its elements. 
 *The matrix has a row and column arrangement of its elements.
 *A matrix with m rows and n columns can be called as m Ã— n matrix. 
 *Individual entries in the matrix are called element and can be represented by aij which suggests that the element a is present in the ith row and jth column.
