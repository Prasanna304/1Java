/*
 * Interface contains abstract functions
 * Need to create with Interface keyword
 * 		Package -> Right click -> new -> interface -> Name: InterfaceIntro
 * Contains only Description not definition
 * After 1.8 allows default() static() with definition
 * Non-Static function is preferable in interface 
 * If i remove static in functions like credit debit loan then it shows error so remove definition
 * Implementation is compulsory
 * @overide -> shows it is a override function
 * Blue triangle shows user defined
 * Green triangle shows preloaded 
 *
